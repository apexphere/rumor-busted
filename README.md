# Rumor Busted

> Bust tech rumors and hype with research-backed analysis.

## Why This Exists

The AI/tech space is drowning in noise:
- Hot takes spread faster than facts
- "X is dead" / "Y replaces Z" posts go viral without evidence
- People make decisions based on hype, not reality

**Rumor Busted** cuts through the BS. We research claims, trace sources, and deliver verdicts.

## Origin Story

February 2026: People were posting "MCP is being replaced by skills" across social media. 

We did the research:
- MCP is alive and actively maintained
- Google's A2A protocol explicitly says it "complements" MCP
- OpenAI chose their own proprietary approach — that's not MCP dying
- "Skills" is just different terminology in different frameworks

**Verdict: Rumor Busted.**

That's the energy. Research first, verdict second.

## How It Works

1. **Spot a rumor** — trending claims, hot takes, "X is dead" posts
2. **Research** — trace sources, check official docs, verify claims
3. **Verdict** — Busted, Confirmed, or Partially True (with context)
4. **Publish** — clear, sourced, no-BS breakdown

## Status
